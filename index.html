          <h4>Fun facts about Quincy</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>His name reminds me of quinces.</li>
            <li>
              I heard that Quincy had an 8-pack. That Quincy was shredded.
            </li>
            <li>No, but seriously, the guy is RIPPED. Google it.</li>
            <li>I heard he codes. (not sure tho)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            "My favourite part about working with him was when he'd say 'It's
            codin' time!' and then he'd proceed to code all over the place."
